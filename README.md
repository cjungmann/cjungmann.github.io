# GitHub Website for Chuck Jungmann

This GitHub Pages project will summarize and provide links to my GitHub
projects to make it easier for someone to read about my programming goals
and accomplishments.

Like all my projects, a secondary goal of creating a GitHub page is to learn
about and practice the possibilities of an unfamiliar framework.
