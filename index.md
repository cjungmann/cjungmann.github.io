# Chuck Jungmann's GitHub Page

Several years ago, having finally committed to using source control and
learned how to use *git*, I created an account on GitHub to save my
projects.  While older projects can, theoretically, still be retrieved
from abandoned computers mouldering in my basement, I am much more
comfortable with the ease of access GitHub offers, especially when I
move to a new computer.

Having an easily accessible history of my programming endeavors has
inspired me to organize my thoughts differently.  For me, programming
had always been about pursuing deeper understanding, trying to notice
and exploit unexpected features of a language or environment.  Some
ideas work and some fail, but all ideas, sufficiently explored and
documented, can lend guidance to future projects.  To that end, I
work at improving my code-writing and documentation techniques to
make it easier to apply hard-earned knowledge to newer projects.

The other benefit of having a public repository of my work is that
show off a bit.  It is the showing-off that inspired me to create
this page, to make easier to browse my projects without having to
visit each repository.

## GitHub Projects

### [Schema Framework](https://github.com/cjungmann/schemafw)

This project is in two parts
- a FastCGI server object, written in C++, that returns XML
  documents from MySQL query results, and
- a large and growing client framework that uses HTML, CSS,
  Javascript, XML-Http-Request, and XSLT stylesheets to generate
  pages through which users interact with the MySQL data.

As I write this page I am starting to split the server out of
the primary repository.  I have wanted to do this for a while
because it rarely needs any attention.  Now that I am about to
add a new and somewhat complicated feature that I may
ultimately abandon, it makes sense to start using a development
branch and get serious about maintaining version information.
