# Chuck Jungmann's GitHub Page

Several years ago, having finally committed to using source control and
learned how to use *git*, I created an account on GitHub to save my
projects.  While older projects can, theoretically, still be retrieved
from abandoned computers mouldering in my basement, I am much more
comfortable with the ease of access GitHub offers, especially when I
move to a new computer.

Having an easily accessible history of my programming endeavors has
inspired me to organize my thoughts differently.  For me, programming
had always been about pursuing deeper understanding, trying to notice
and exploit unexpected features of a language or environment.  Some
ideas work and some fail, but all ideas, sufficiently explored and
documented, can lend guidance to future projects.  To that end, I
work at improving my code-writing and documentation techniques to
make it easier to apply hard-earned knowledge to newer projects.

The other benefit of having a public repository of my work is that
show off a bit.  It is the showing-off that inspired me to create
this page, to make easier to browse my projects without having to
visit each repository.
